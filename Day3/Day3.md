## Linked List Fundamentals

**Types**:
* Singly Linked List
  A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are connected by pointers.
  Each node consists of two parts: a data field, which stores the actual data, and a pointer field, which stores a pointer to the next node.
  The pointer field of the last node points to `null` indicating the end of the list.

  The entry point of the linked list is called the head node, referred to as `head`.
  The pointer field in a singly linked list can only point to the next node.

* Doubly Linked List
  Each node has two pointer fields, one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node.
  And it allows traversal both forward and backward.
  





* Circular Linked List
